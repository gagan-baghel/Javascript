This is a Simon game written in JavaScript. The goal of the game is to repeat a sequence of colors that are randomly generated by the computer.
The player must remember and repeat the sequence correctly in order to win. The game starts with a single color,
and each time the player successfully repeats the sequence, an additional color is added to the end of it.
The game ends when the player fails to correctly repeat the sequence.

The game features four colored buttons: red, green, blue, and yellow.
Each button has its own sound associated with it. When a color is randomly generated by the computer,
its corresponding sound will be played as well as its button flashing briefly.

The game also features a score counter which keeps track of how many sequences have been successfully repeated by the player.
It also keeps track of how long it took for each sequence to be repeated correctly.

Good luck!
