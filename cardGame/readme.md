This is a simple card flip game made with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. The goal of the game
is to match all the cards in pairs by flipping them over. 


  Instructions: 
  1. Click on any card to flip it over and reveal its image. 
  2. Try to match two cards with the same image by clicking on them one at a time. 
  3. If the two cards match, they will stay flipped over and you can move onto the next pair. 
  4. If the two cards do not match, they will flip back over and you can try again with different cards. 
  5. The game is complete when all of the cards have been matched in pairs! 

Enjoy!
